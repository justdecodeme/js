What It Means to Be Functional:
-------------------------------
JavaScript supports functional programming because JavaScript functions are first-class citizens. This means that 
functions can do the same things that variables can do. The latest JavaScript syntax adds language improvements 
that can beef up your functional programming techniques, including arrow functions, promises, and the spread operator.

In a functional program, data is immutable. It never changes.

Pure Functions
--------------
A pure function is a function that returns a value that’s computed based on its arguments. Pure functions take at 
least one argument and always return a value or another function. They do not cause side effects, set global variables, 
or change anything about application state. They treat their arguments as immutable data.

Pure functions are another core concept of functional programming. They will make your life much easier because they 
will not affect your application’s state. When writing functions, try to follow these three rules:
- The function should take in at least one argument.
- The function should return a value or another function.
- The function should not change or mutate any of its arguments.
