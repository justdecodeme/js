            A promise is used to handle the asynchronous result of an operation. 
            It defers the execution of a code block until an asynchronous request
            is completed. This way, other operations can keep running without
            interruption. 

            A promise has 3 states:
            - Pending: It means the operation is going on.
            - Fulfilled: It means the operation was complted.
            - Rejected: It means the operation did not complete and an error
                        can be thrown.

            syntax:
            const mPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                // Promise body
                // Call resolve() 
                // Call reject()
            })
         */

        /* EXAMPLE 01 */

        const ar = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

        const evenNos = ar.filter(value => {
            return value % 2 == 0;
        });

        console.log(evenNos);
