        /* MAP */
        /* Just like map(), reduce() also iterates through the entire array and it
            accepts a callback function to perform some action on the array element.
            The difference there is that reduce() passes the result of the callback
            from one interation to the next one. This callback result is called
            accumulator. The accumulator can be pretty much anything (integer,
            string, object or even an array) and must be instantiated and passed
            when calling reduce().

            syntax:
            arr.reduce((acc, value) => {
                // callback function
            }, acc_default_value);
         */

        /* EXAMPLE 01 */

        const ar = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

        const sum = ar.reduce((acc, value) => {
            return acc + value;
        });

        console.log(sum);
