// it is also present now on the server (NodeJS) and database as well (MongoDB)

// Learning data structures and algorithms is very important for any technology professional. Since
// Data structure and algorithms can solve the most common problems efficiently. This will make 
// a difference to the quality of the source code you write in the future (including performance)

// As best practice, we should include any js code at the end of the body tag. This way, the HTML will 
// be parsed by the browser and displayed before the scripts are loaded. This boosts the performance 
// of the page.

// You may hear that global variables in JS are evil and this is true. Usually, the quality of JS source code
// is measured by the number of global variables and functions (a large number is bad). So, whenever possible,
// try avoiding global variables.

// In Object Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class

// ECMAScript is a scripting language specification. JavaScript is an implementation of this specification, 
// as are Jscript and ActionScript

// ECMAScript 2015 == ES6
// ECMAScript 2016 == ES7

// ECMAScript 6 functionalities (✗✓)
// ----------------------------------
// let and const (✓)
// Template literals (✓)
// Destructuring Assignment (✓)
// Spread and Rest operator (✓)
// Arrow functions using => (✓)
// Classes (✓)
// Default parameters (✓)
// iterators (✗)
// typed arrays (✗)
// Set  (✗)
// Map (✗)
// WeakSet (✗)
// WeakMap (✗)
// modules (✗)
// tail calls (✗)
// Symbol (✗)

// let and const has same begavior except variable defined as const has a read-only value, meaning a constant value.

// It is good to remember that JavaScript object-oriented programming is done through prototype
