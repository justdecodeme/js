// Learning data structures and algorithms is very important for any technology professional. Since
// Data structure and algorithms can solve the most common problems efficiently. This will make 
// a difference to the quality of the source code you write in the future (including performance)

// As best practice, we should include any js code at the end of the body tag. This way, the HTML will 
// be parsed by the browser and displayed before the scripts are loaded. This boosts the performance 
// of the page.

// You may hear that global variables in JS are evil and this is true. Usually, the quality of JS source code
// is measured by the number of global variables and functions (a large number is bad). So, whenever possible,
// try avoiding global variables.
